# English School Website

It was created using **Gatsby JS** and **Contenful**

Everytime theres new content on Contentful, a webhook is triggered which runs a build in [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), rebuilds the site and publish it into [English School](https://bristolingles.com.mx/).

### Install

On root rolder `yarn install`, this will also install dependencies on gatsby folder.

While is possible to run `yarn start`, `env variables` are needed, which obviously are not present on repo.

<ins>This repo is for demonstration purposes</ins>.
